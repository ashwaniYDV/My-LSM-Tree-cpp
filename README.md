# My-LSM-Tree-cpp

* Implemented a Log-Structured Merge Tree (LSM Tree) Key-Value Storage Engine in C++, drawing inspiration from databases like Bitcask, LevelDB, RocskDB, etc.

## About
* Lightning-fast writes by appending data directly to a binary file, optimizing write performance.
* Reads are highly efficient, leveraging an in-memory index to store byte offsets of the latest records in the data file. 
* It is fault-tolerant, persisting both data and index to the file system.
* Supports crash recovery through "write-ahead logging," allowing the reconstruction of the index in case of system crashes during the persistence process.
* Data is stored across multiple immutable files + one active/mutable file for handling large data. 

## TODO
* Write a compaction algorithm (running in background) to merge older chunks and their indexes. (Since data file is append only, a key can be present in multiple files but its latest record will be in one of the latest files.)
* Implement LSM tree.

## How to run
```
make clean
make run
```
